# Instagram Clone  

This is my long-term project, where I will focus on learning the fundamentals of server-side programming, creating both static and dynamic web pages, and handling server-client interactions using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript).  

This project is a simple **Instagram clone** built with:  
- **EJS** for templating  
- **Express.js** as the backend framework  
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the front-end, replicating Instagram's user interface  

## Features  

- **User Profiles**: Displays profile information, including followers, following, and posts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with posts (like, comment, and share) and view images in a grid layout.  
- **Basic Navigation**: Includes essential navigation elements like Home, Search, Messages, and Profile.
